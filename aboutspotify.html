<h1>About us</h1>
<br><div><h2> Spotify  is a proprietary Swedish audio streaming and media services provider founded on 23 April 2006 by<br>
     Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon. It is one of the largest music streaming service providers, with over 422<br>
      million monthly active users, including 182 million paying subscribers, as of March 2022. Spotify is listed<br>
       (through a Luxembourg City-domiciled holding company, Spotify Technology S.A.) on the New York Stock <br>
       Exchange in the form of American depositary receipts.<br>

    Spotify offers digital copyright restricted recorded music and podcasts, including more than 82 million songs,<br>
     from record labels and media companies.As a freemium service, basic features are free with advertisements<br>
      and limited control, while additional features, such as offline listening and commercial-free listening, are<br>
       offered via paid subscriptions. Spotify is currently available in 180+ countries, as of October 2021. Users<br>
        can search for music based on artist, album, or genre, and can create, edit, and share playlists.<br>
    
    Spotify is available in most of Europe, as well as the Americas and Oceania, with a total availability in<br>
     184 markets.The service is available on most devices including Windows, macOS, and Linux computers,<br>
      iOS and Android smartphones and tablets, smart home devices such as the Amazon Echo and Google Nest lines of products <br>
    
    Unlike physical or download sales, which pay artists a fixed price per song or album sold, Spotify pays<br>
     royalties based on the number of artist streams as a proportion of total songs streamed. It distributes<br>
      approximately 70% of its total revenue to rights holders (often record labels), who then pay artists<br>
       based on individual agreements.According to Ben Sisario of The New York Times, approximately 13,000 <br>
       out of seven million artists on Spotify generated $50,000 or more in payments in 2020.</div><br></h2></body>
